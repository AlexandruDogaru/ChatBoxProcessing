# ChatBoxProcessing
This is a client-server application made in Processing, the main functionality is that of a chatting application, but it can be extended for other uses as well.

For details about how this application works and why I made some code decision consult the documentation.

This Processing application was made by me(Alexandru Dogaru) in the spring of 2017 as the final project for my begineer entry certification in Informatics. Awarded by the Romanian government.
