# ChatBoxProcessing
This is a client-server application made in Processing, the main functionality is that of a chatting application, but it can be extended for other uses as well.

For details about how this application works and why I made some code decision consult the documentation.

## How to run the application
1. Download Processing from: https://processing.org/download/
2. Open host.pde using Processing
3. Open port forwarding on your router
4. Find out the IPv4 of the machine that is running the host file
5. Change line 13 to have the port you opened and your IPv4
6. Run the application from the IDE
Now you have the server up and running!
7. Now open the client.pde file
8. Change line 15 to have the port and IPv4 of the Host, so you can communicate with the host
9. You and your friend can now run a client each and have fun!
Thank you for reading!

This Processing application was made by me (Alexandru Dogaru) in the spring of 2017 as the final project for my begineer entry certification in Informatics. Awarded by the Romanian government.
